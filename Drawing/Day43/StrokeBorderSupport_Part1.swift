             What you are seeing here is
             a side effect of the way SwiftUI draws borders around shapes .
             If you handed someone a pencil outline of a circle
             and asked them to draw over that circle with a thick pen ,
             they would trace the exact line of the circle
             â€“ about half the pen would be inside the line , and half outside .
             This is what SwiftUI is doing for us ,
             but where our shapes go to the edge of the screen
             it means the outside part of the border ends up beyond our screen edges .

             All our border is visible ,
             because Swift strokes the inside of the circle
             rather than centering on the line .
